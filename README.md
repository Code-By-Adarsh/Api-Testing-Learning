# 🔥 API Testing Learning – Postman + Rest Assured

This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing **API Testing** using both **Postman** (manual API testing) and **Rest Assured** (Java-based API automation).  
It includes step-by-step learning, sample APIs, collections, test scripts, automation code, and practical exercises to build real API testing skills.
